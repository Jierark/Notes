First, some more linear algebra review. Mostly contains useful terms to remember.

The **Span** of a set of vectors $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z}$ is the set of vectors that can be reached by a linear combination of the three vectors. Mathematically, we express this as 
$\{a \vec{x} + b \vec{y} + c \vec{z} \in R^3\}$. It isn't necessarily all of R^3, just that the resulting vectors are in that space.
