The goal for this lecture is to give a high level overview of data-driven decision making models. It will show you when to use specific frameworks, and the key decisions, tradeoffs, and challenges to consider for each one.

# Supervised Machine Learning
Imagine you wanted to write a program that could predict whether it was going to rain tomorrow. You would quickly run into a problem that trying to make that prediction based on what you know is difficult.

Although we don't have the concrete rules, we do have a lot of data about this. How could we use it to help us? This is where supervised machine learning comes in.

We have some input data, and their associated labels. We can feed them into a supervised learning algorithm, which will produce a model that can best predict labels based on the inputs.

So, what could go wrong here?

There's always an underlying assumption that the data is "good". This class will focus on that question, looking at where the data came from and where it could go wrong.

Where can data come from, anyways?
