Purpose of the class - Studying the Internet, data centers, wireless networks, and networked systems
Additionally - studying how AI can design better networked systems

The Internet is probably one of the most influential inventions of the last century. It's hard to believe that a small research experiment ballooned into a global connectivity system. In fact, 63% of the world (more than 5 billion people!) use the Internet, 92% of which are via mobile devices. Don't forget, there's even more devices being added to the internet with IoT, and the rapid growth of AI is also adding to the connectivity of the Internet.

Networks are everywhere in our lives today. They play a role in many aspects of society:
- Online learning has become a huge source of knowledge; you honestly could teach yourself so much
- Business, whether it is e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising (ugh) have become essential for shoppers and companies
- Social media, for better or worse, have connected the world together and informed people of news from across the globe.
- Networks present new questions in law and order, from interstate commerce to national boundaries, censorship, and wiretapping.
- Cyber warfare has become a silent but relevant threat to all governments, and misinformation has also become hugely relevant.
All these problems present new grounds for continuous innovation: new apps, protocols, and hardware.

# Networking as a Research Discipline
So...what really is Networking as research?

There's so, so many acronyms in this field. Stuff like IP, TCP, HTTP, BGP, RTP, SMTP...you get the idea.

There's also a ton of theory (not surprising whatsoever). Here's a brief list of some of these theory fields:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Graph Theory
- Control Theory
- Queueing Theory
- Optimization Theory
- Game Theory and Mechanism Design
- Cryptography
- Programming Languages
- Formal Methods

System Engineering also goes a long way here. Pull from these computer engineering fields:
- Distributed Systems
- Operating Systems
- Computer Architecture
- Software Engineering

AI, of course, is also changing the landscape of the field. We can design new algorithms with ML, but the workload of these systems present new challenges for networked systems.

Ok, let's set a definition
## A network is a system with interconnected nodes
Networking draws from many disciplines and combines them to solve the problem of sending information between nodes.
- From distributed systems: networking deals with how nodes are connected, while distributed systems had always assumed some kind of connectivity. It turns out there are many common problems to solve in both fields
- From operating systems: The creation of end-host networking stacks
- From computer architecture - Network interface cards and router hardware
- From software engineering - protocol design, control plane design
- From AI - AI is creating solutions for complex networked systems, but AI workloads created a demand for new network designs

## Why is networking cool?
- It's relevant - practically everything runs on a network (the Internet)
- It's interdisciplinary - problems and solutions can be found in different areas of computer science, electrical engineering, policy, and economics
- The papers are widely cited and read. Some examples are congestion control, distributed hash tables, resource reservation, protocol designs,
- It's still a young field - There is room for much intellectual progress
- Defining the problem is a big part of the challenge. It's about as important as the solution.
- There are many tools and platforms to build ideas

# History of the Internet
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik-1, the first artificial satellite to enter space. This surprised the U.S. in the midst of the Cold War, which led to the formation of ARPA (now DARPA) in February 1958.

Packet Switching started its journey between 1959 and 1965.
- In the early 1960s, Baran of RAND Corp created new approaches for survivable comms systems such that 1 link being down wouldn't take an entire telephone network with a a paper on switching over digital links
- The term "Packet" was coined in the early 1960s by  Davies in the UK
- Kleinrock in his MIT thesis discussed "Information flow in large communication nets"
- Licklider & Clark then wrote *On-line Man Computer Communication* in 1962
 L. Roberts then published the first plans of the ARPAnet in 1967 for time-sharing remote computers. The ARPAnet would be developed during the year, connecting computers at key research sites across the US using telephone lines. The Interface Message Processor (IMP) developed by BBN with an ARPA contract was used to connect all these computers (which was basically an even larger computer)

The first connection crashed after LOG was typed.
