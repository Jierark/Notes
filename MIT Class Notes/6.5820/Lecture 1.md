Purpose of the class - Studying the Internet, data centers, wireless networks, and networked systems
Additionally - studying how AI can design better networked systems

The Internet is probably one of the most influential inventions of the last century. It's hard to believe that a small research experiment ballooned into a global connectivity system. In fact, 63% of the world (more than 5 billion people!) use the Internet, 92% of which are via mobile devices. Don't forget, there's even more devices being added to the internet with IoT, and the rapid growth of AI is also adding to the connectivity of the Internet.

Networks are everywhere in our lives today. They play a role in many aspects of society:
- Online learning has become a huge source of knowledge; you honestly could teach yourself so much
- Business, whether it is e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising (ugh) have become essential for shoppers and companies
- Social media, for better or worse, have connected the world together and informed people of news from across the globe.
- Networks present new questions in law and order, from interstate commerce to national boundaries, censorship, and wiretapping.
- Cyber warfare has become a silent but relevant threat to all governments, and misinformation has also become hugely relevant.
All these problems present new grounds for continuous innovation: new apps, protocols, and hardware.

# Networking as a Research Discipline
So...what really is Networking as research?

There's so, so many acronyms in this field. Stuff like IP, TCP, HTTP, BGP, RTP, SMTP...you get the idea.

There's also a ton of theory (not surprising whatsoever). Here's a brief list of some of these theory fields:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Graph Theory
- Control Theory
- Queueing Theory
- Optimization Theory
- Game Theory and Mechanism Design
- Cryptography
- Programming Languages
- Formal Methods

System Engineering also goes a long way here. Pull from these computer engineering fields:
- Distributed Systems
- Operating Systems
- Computer Architecture
- Software Engineering

AI, of course, is also changing the landscape of the field. We can design new algorithms with ML, but the workload of these systems present new challenges for networked systems.
