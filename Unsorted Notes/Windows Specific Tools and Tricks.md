# FAT 12/16/32 (File Allocation Table)
Early file systems designed for devices with limited amounts of storage. The number represents how many bits are used to represent a "data cluster", and each one has a different limit on the largest file that can be held.
# NTFS (New Technology File System)
Default file system for Windows, starting with Windows NT 3.1. Addresses many of the pitfalls of the previous FAT system, and offers more reliability and security in file storage.
Can view and change permission of files with the icacls command
# SMB (Server Message Block)
Windows protocol to access shared resources on a network, such as files or printers. 
# SC
Command line interface for interacting with Windows Service Control Manager. Allows for querying, stopping, and starting of services, as well as examining service permissions. Service permissions can also be seen using Get-Acl Powershell cmdlet
# WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
Subsystem of Powershell that provides tools for system monitoring
Invoke using ```wmic``` in command line or ```Get-WmiObject``` in Powershell
# MMC (Microsoft Management Console)
Tool to group snap-ins (admin tools) to management hardware/software/network components in a Windows system. Allows sysadmins to create and distribute collection of tools to users (I think?)
# WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Allows linux binaries to be run within a windows environment. Can access storage volumes via the ```/mnt``` directory.
# Security Identifier
Unique string tied to each security principle, generated by the system automatically.
Formatted as ```(SID)-(revision level)-(identifier-authority)-(subauthority1)-(subauthority2)-(etc)```
The breakdown is as follows:

| **Number**                      | **Meaning**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S                               | SID                  | Identifies the string as a SID.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1                               | Revision Level       | To date, this has never changed and has always beenÂ `1`.                                                                                                                                           |
| 5                               | Identifier-authority | A 48-bit string that identifies the authority (the computer or network) that created the SID.                                                                                                      |
| 21                              | Subauthority1        | This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group described by the SID to the authority that created it. It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account. |
| 674899381-4069889467-2080702030 | Subauthority2        | Tells us which computer (or domain) created the number                                                                                                                                             |
| 1002                            | Subauthority3        | The RID that distinguishes one account from another. Tells us whether this user is a normal user, a guest, an administrator, or part of some other group                                           |
