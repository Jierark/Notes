Wireshark is an open source packet analyzer, capable of sniffing and intercepting live traffic. It is a useful tool for getting deeper insight into different protocols, troubleshooting network issues, and detecting anomalous security activity. Note that this software will not allow you to make changes to any packets; there are other tools for those kinds of purposes.
## The Basics
The main functionality of Wireshark is to look at the raw bytes that are being sent and received by some device. Thus, Wireshark offers multiple tools and tricks to help people understand what a giant string of bytes actually represents.
Packets sent through an internet connection are formatted according to the TCP/IP model. They can be further filtered, marked, or commenting to facilitate analysis. Wireshark hosts a suite of additional functionality for filtering packets (just look it up honestly)
