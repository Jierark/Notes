On average, there are 2,000 cases of boiler accidents per year. To avoid these, boiler operators have many responsibilities to ensure smooth operation of the boiler.

# Operator Responsibilities for Boiler Safety
1. Maintain Normal Operating Water Level
2.  Never add cold water to a hot boiler when the water level is unknown.
3. Test safety relief valves regularly in compliance with state and local codes.
4.  Follow standard operating procedures and all instructions from the Chief Engineer.
5. Maintain proper steam pressure or water temperature.
6. Routinely test low low water fuel cutoffs and feedwater pump controls.
7. Regularly blowdown the water column, water gauge (sight glass), and try cocks.
8. Maintain burner according to manufacturer's recommendations.
9.  Maintain proper fuel oil temperature and/or gas pressure
10. Record fuel consumption regularly
11. Maintain optimum feedwater temperature.
12. Record make-up water consumption regularly.
13. Monitor and record stack temperature. (temp. Increase in stack losing heat) #clarify 
14. Maintain control of the boiler at all times. Observe operation of the boiler and auxiliary equipment.
15. Maintain boiler room log. Record all appropriate data and document any unusual conditions.

# Maintenance
Keeping the boiler in peak operating condition is vital for the long-term. Specific rules and guidelines can be found in Sections VI and VII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Reviewing these sections is a good first step in creating a preventative maintenance program
## General steps for reliable boiler operation
1. Review manuals of boiler and auxiliary equipment (know and understand the equipment)
2. Require a standard operating procedure manual for the boiler room. This should detail operation and maintenance procedures of the boiler and other equipment and be updated as equipment is replaced or repaired.
3. Keep a written log sheet to track any activities related to the boiler, and establish regular maintenance procedures, noting any abnormalities during these processes.
4. Maintain accurate and complete records of service, repairs, and replacement of boiler room components, including pumps, motors, and belts.
5. Monitor water consumption of the boiler system on a regular basis. Any irregularity in the amount is usually the first sign of a problem. All systems that have a make-up water line need a make-up water meter.
6. Monitor fuel consumption of the burner. Changes in this can also be an indicator of system problems.
7. Ensure the boiler room has adequate air for combustion and ventilation. Air is a major component of combustion, and not having enough leads to wasted fuel. The boiler room should contain a positive pressure, which means air will naturally flow out of the room (meaning proper ventilation).
8. Maintain electrical equipment inside the boiler room. Keeping them dry and clean will minimize the risk of possible electrical failures.
9. Keep the boiler room clean and orderly (obviously)
10.  Follow approved safety practices in and around the boiler room, and follow relevant OSHA procedures for locknut tag-out, confined spaces, and personal protective equipment. Working on electrical equipment carries the risk of arc flash hazards. Burns and chemical contact are some among the dangers of a boiler room.

## Baselining
System baselining establishes a record of the system's normal operating characteristics. It's a good starting point to diagnose problems with the system. Operators and technicians should have this on hand when servicing the boiler.

### Guidelines for Baseline
1. Manufacturer of equipment
2. Type of system (steam, hot water heat, process)
3. Nameplate information
	1. Pertinent information related to the boiler or other related equipment, including but not limited to:
	2. Model and Serial Number
	3. Manufacturer number, and date of manufacturing
	4. Square feet of surface area
	5. Capacity (horsepower, PPH, Btu/hr)
	6. Type of fuel used
	7. Operating Pressure
	8. Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP)
4. Temperature and pressure readings during normal operation
5. Auxiliary Equipment
	1. Type and Purpose
	2. Manufacturer
	3. Model number
	4. Location in the system
6. Controls - safety and operating controls should be tested during baselining. Relevant information to record includes control type and manufacturer model number
7. Piping system - draw a system piping diagram, noting all pipe sizes, valves, controls, and all other components.
8. Measuring Efficiency and Emissions
	- Combustion Efficiency #clarify 
		- Flue Gas Analysis - allows a  technician to determine the boiler efficiency
		- Combustion reactions, in a perfect reaction, will only produce steam (H2O), nitrogen gas (N2), and carbon dioxide (CO2)
		- Efficiently operating steam generators have a normal stack temperature range between 250-350 degrees F
	-  Heat exchange losses
	- Flue gas analysis
	- Emissions
	- Important Note: burning fossil fuels will only accomplish partial heat transfer. This is because converting the energy from a chemical reaction to thermal energy. Analyzing the combustion process is intended to improve plant fuel economy and the safety of the fuel-burning equipment. Additionally, the creation and delivering of steam or hot water also results in some loss of heat
	- Evaluation of plant efficiency also needs to consider loses from convection (leaking of steam or hot water) and radiation (loss of heat from the boiler shell naturally heating the air around)
# Emissions
The first Clean Air act passed in 1963 to regulate emissions. In 1990, a series of amendments were passed to further the role of the government in protecting the environment. Out of the eleven titles passed under this act, Title I is the most important.
## Title I
Title I covers attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), putting its focus on six "criteria" pollutants: Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulates, and Lead. Under Title I, the government established monitoring stations to determine whether locations have exceeded any of the levels set for these six pollutants.

An area is designated as an "attainment" area if it does not exceed the limits. Those that do exceed limits are designated as "nonattainment area", and further classified to the level of ambient pollutants, ranging from "marginal" to "extreme".

# Water Treatment Equipment
Steam boiler water treatment chemicals are best applied by use of a ***demand-based automatic system***, adding chemical compounds based on make-up water quantity and current water conditions.

# Water Chemistry
New boilers and piping systems will have a layer of oil used in the manufacturing process, often applied as a surface corrosion preventive. It is important to remove this oil completely before operating. Failure to do so can result in priming and foaming in steam boilers, as well as water carryover into the steam system #clarify  (what is water carryover). In hot water systems, the oil prevents the desired corrosion inhibitor from fully protecting the metal surfaces and promotes biological growth.

## System Cleaning
Cleaning hot water systems is accomplished by adding and circulating some chemical cleaning compound, typically a blend of sodium hydroxide and tri-sodium phosphate. Sodium carbonate can also be used. Regardless of solution, it should be introduced as per manufacturer instructions, circulated and cleaned. Note that it is imperative that the operator shuts off any valves that could leak this solution into undesirable locations, such as a city water main.

# Boiler Blowdown
Blowdown involves removing water from within the boiler to clean the insides. It is a vital step in ensuring the longevity of a boiler.

- Feedwater from city lines and other sources typically contain "impurities", such as sediments and minerals. These settle at the bottom of the boiler as the water that carries them is heated and converted to steam, and builds up, leading to corrosion and other problems. Performing bottom blowdown #clarify on the boiler removes the sludge and sediments from the boiler.
- Hard scale/boiler scale, which are insoluble salts that build up on boiler tubes and walls, are best removed with air or water turbines. These result from the hardness of the water containing calcium and magnesium ions.
- Blowdown should be performed at least once a day. If the boiler is used during multiple shifts in a day, then each shift must be responsible for performing blowdown either at the start or at the end.
- Blowdown is performed when the boiler has cooled down to a low pressure. The top blowdown should be performed 3 times for 10-15 seconds each, or until clean water comes up #clarify, then the bottom blowdown is performed for 20-30 seconds.
- The bottom blowdown tube has a minimum of 1 1/2" and a maximum size of 2 1/2". If the boiler has under 100 square feet of heating surface, the line size can be smaller.
- Any boiler that can operate at higher than 100 psi must have 2 blowdown valves, with a quick-closing valve closer to the boiler, and a screw-type valve further away.
- Surface blowdown is located NOWL #clarify 
- The order of the blowdown pathway is boiler --> mud drum --> blowdown tank --> sewer
- Blowdown can also be used to control the amount of chemical in the boiler, which is useful if the interior requires some chemicals for a deeper cleaning.
- If there is too much water in the boiler (to the point where water is coming out of the top try cock, or it is way too high in the water column), blowdown can be used to lower the amount of water inside.

# ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Code
- Every boiler and boiler fittings in the state of New Jersey must meet ASME standards.
- We are testing for White Special Boiler License
- Operating a boiler without a license results in a minimum fine of $500 per day, with a maximum of $5000 per day.
- The maximum capacity allowed is 100 horsepower, and a minimum of 15 psig. #clarify 
- In New Jersey, boiler licenses are issued by the Bureau of Boiler & Pressure Vessel Compliances
