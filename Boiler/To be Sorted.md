- Carbon dioxide in a condensate return system causes channeling
- 1 pound of steam per hour is equivalent to 1,000 BTU/hour
- A Steam trap allows condensate to pass through, but prevents steam from passing through #expand 
- An increase in the temperature of combustion gases at the boiler outlet is usually due to dirty heating surfaces.
- Boilers in battery equipped with Manhole openings must have two main steam stop valves and a free-blowing drain between them
- In order to be sure the gauge glass is indicating an accurate water level reading, the stationary engineer should blow down the water column.
- A continuous blowdown line is located in the steam and water drum well below the NOWL.
- Chimney temperature above 250 degree F indicates poor boiler efficiency
- Higher pressure will raise the boiling point of water.
- If a lather is not obtained when performing a soap hardness test, the water sample is hard.
- Combustion efficiency can be increased if the air is preheated
- A steam turbine's overdraft trip should be tested before putting it online. The trip should trigger if the turbine's RPM exceeds 10% of its normal operation speed.
- Chemically treating feedwater is done to convert scale forming salts into a non-adhering sludge, which can be removed during blowdown.
- Water in a deareator feedwater heater is prevented from entering the steam line by a loop seal or internal overflow #clarify 
- The steam line going to the soot blowers is connected to the main steam drum. Additionally, the soot blower lines should be drained before using them.
- A globe valve installed in the feedwater line between the feedwater pump and boiler has pressure from the feedwater pump under the valve disc.

- 1 Therm (thm) is equivalent to 100,000 BTU, which is the energy content of about 100 cubic feet of natural gas at standard temperature and pressure.
- The safety valve setting on the steam and water drum should be higher than the superheater safety valve.
- No.6 fuel oil has a BTU content of about 18,750 BTU/lb.
- A proportioning pump should be used to add chemicals to a boiler.
- Feedwater stop valve should be between the boiler and check valve
- Steam space of a boiler must be large enough to separate the water from the steam.

- Packaged boiler is built ready for installation.
- Hot water supply boilers are considered heating boilers if the operating temperature exceeds 200 degrees F
- In a firetube boiler, increasing the number of tube passes augments the heat transfer capability (more surface area to heat up water)
- High pressure water tubes can be of various straight for bent configurations #clarify 
- Bent tube boiler design allows the tubes to be attached radially on the outside of the drum #expand 
- Since the pressure in a packaged watertube boiler is often positive, to prevent flue gas from leaking, a steal casing is used to form a seal on the furnace.
- One problem with a D type watertube packaged boiler is excessive vibration.
- Some advantages of low pressure water tube and tubular type boilers are the very short warm up period required, bent or coil tube design avoids thermal stress, and rapid response to fluctuating loads.
- One disadvantage of electric boilers is that they require a lot of energy to run.
- Operating voltage for an electrode type boiler can be as high as 16,000 volts.
