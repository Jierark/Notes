It's also important to recognize different parts of a boiler and their function. Some contribute to the heating element, while others are extremely important for safety reasons. This section details the possible working parts that contribute to the boiler's operation.
# Various Valves and Parts
- Check Valve - only allows water to flow in one direction. Important in cases where water should not be flowing backwards.![[checkvalve.jpg]]
	- Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) / Backflow Preventer - a specific check valve on main water line to prevent contamination of domestic water supply
- Globe Valve - controls pressure, regulating the flow of steam or water![[globevalve.jpg]]
	- Used when steam flows in under the seat, and up out the outlet
	- The classic valve that one has to turn many times.
- Stop valve - used to open and close valves. Typically ball valves are used for this.
- ![[stopvalve(ball).jpg]]
	- Slow-opening valves - larger handles which takes 5 full revolutions to open and close (basically a globe valve)
	- Water column line will typically see a lever (ball valve) to drain it.
- Automatic nonreturn valve - check valve for main steam line
- "pig tail" siphon - typically seen on gauges, these are designed to protect the gauge from high temperatures (the loop doesn't affect the readings)![[siphon.webp]]
- Dry pipe - perforated pipe which separates water and steam 
- Try cock - secondary water reading value
![[trycock.png]]
- Water column - primary water level reading
- Pressure/Vaporstat Control - used to control the limit of operating range of the steam or hot water boiler, respectively. Turns off the heating element when the upper range is reached.
	- Pressure control has cut in pressure and differential pressure scales
- High limit control - maintains the maximum limit for the boiler, and will shut down the boiler if triggered. This acts as a backup to the pressure control.
- Superheater - heats steam to 500 degrees F
	- Superheater drain is used to establish steam flow
- Economizer - preheats feedwater that enters the boiler, reducing the amount of energy required to convert the water to steam or hot water.
	- In general, every 10 degrees F of additional heat will save 1% more fuel from being burned.
- Closed Feedwater Heater - same role as economizer, located between boiler and feedwater pump
- Flash tank *(return tank?)* - recovers low pressure steam, which can be refed into the boiler
- Feedwater regulator - maintains constant water level
- Lead sulfide cell (photocell) - used as flame failure control due to its sensitivity to infrared light
- Solenoid Valve - direct-acting valve in gas system, acts as an automatic gas shutoff valve (useful since it will open and close based on electrical signals)
- Aqua stat - controls the starting and stopping of burner by measuring temperature of water. Only present in hot water boilers.
- Air control removes air from a hot water boiler system.
- Draft gauge = manometer, read in inches of water. Measures the difference of pressure in gas systems.
- Some heating systems use a thermostat to control the circulation pump
- Pressure reducing valve - used in hot water boilers to reduce incoming city water pressure to operating pressure
- Breeching is a set of pipes and ducts that moves exhaust gases from a boiler to the chimney of exhaust stack.
- Baffles - used to direct the flow of gases throughout the boiler
	- A broken baffle will cause a sudden rise in chimney temperature, with no increase in load.
- A Steam trap allows water to pass through, but prevents steam from passing through.
- Flame scanner - monitors and detects the presence of a flame. To test if it is working, passing your hand over the scanner should shut off the fuel supply.
# Safety Valve
![[safetyvalve.jpg]]
- This is the ***MOST IMPORTANT*** part in the boiler. This is there to prevent many, many accidents from ever happening. The safety valve prevents the boiler from exceeding its Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP).
- Spring-load type valves should close automatically while at Normal Working Pressure. Manual testing is possible at 70% of popping pressure. There are two ways to test:
	- Accumulation test - after closing the main steam valve,  increase pressure to 10% above MAWP.
	- Hydrostatic test - after closing the main steam valve, feed water into the boiler until pressure reaches 1.5 times MAWP. This is also a useful test for any leaks or cracks
		- During a hydrostatic test on a boiler, the water temperature should be 70 degrees F
	- These valves should open when a specific capacity is hit, relieving pressure until it lowers to a safe operating level.
- The range of the boiler pressure gauge **must be between 1.5 to 2x the safety valve**. That is, if the safety valve is rated at 200 psi, the pressure gauge should be able to record at least 300 psi and a maximum of 400 psi.
- Capacity should never exceed **6%** above the MAWP. For example, if the MAWP is 150 psi, then the max accumulation test level should not exceed 159 psi.
- Any boiler with more than 500 square feet of heating surface must have two or more safety valves. Additionally, a high pressure boiler requires a safety valve of at least 3/5 inches.
- Setting and adjusting of an SV must be done by maintenance personnel, but repairs of an SV must be done by an authorized representative of the manufacturer.
- High Pressure steam boiler, 15-400 psi perform manual every 6 Months and annually pressure test. 400 psi more every 3 years, hot water boiler greater than 160 psi pressure test annually.  #confusing (not sure what this means)
- Superheater safety valve must be opened before the boiler SV opens
- **Chattering** - the process of opening and closing SV rapidly.
- **Nameplate** - contains Manufacturer Name, Model and Serial number, capacity size, set point and blowback, ASME code and National Board designation
- Safety valves are sealed to prevent tampering with pressure and capacity
- Maximum size of safety valve for a low pressure boiler is 4 1/2 inches.
- High pressure safety valve cannot be used on the same boiler for low pressure
- Safety valve for low pressure boiler should be tested monthly
# Water Column
The water column is the primary water level indicator. It should always be the first thing an operator checks. 

- In normal operation, the water level should be at Normal Operating Water Level (NOWL), rising and falling slowly. 
- Alternatively, the three try cocks on the side can be used to read the water level using the following method:
	- Under normal operation, each try cock corresponds to a different "level" within the boiler. Given that steam tends to rise, one can open a try cock and see if any water comes out. The topmost valve should only release steam, the middle valve should release a mixture of water and steam, and the bottom valve should release hot water.
- The minimum size of the blowdown pipe (which is used to drain the water column) is 1 inch.
- Between the boiler and the water column, an outside screw and a yoke valve.
- It's important to note that the actual water level inside the boiler is always slightly higher than the water column level.
- **Important Note: do not add water or run the boiler if the water column cannot be read and the try cocks cannot be opened. It's imperative that the amount of water inside the boiler is known at all times of operation, and failure to adhere to this note can lead to disaster**
- The minimum size of the drain required on the water column is 3/4 inches.
- In order to be sure the gauge glass is indicating an accurate water level reading, the stationary engineer should blow down the water column.

# Low Water \[Fuel\] Cut Off (LWCO)
This is the **second most** important part of the boiler. The low water cutoff keeps track of the water level and will shut the boiler off if there is too little water inside.

- In the event of low water, the first step is to secure the fire (stop burning of fuel) and let the boiler cool down. **Do not add cold water, as the rapid change in temperature can cause the boiler to collapse on itself** (See Can crush experiment)
- There are three types of LWCO devices: Probe, Float, and Magnetic #TODO add photos
- LWCO should be tested weekly using quick and slow open drain and evaporation tests
	- Quick and Slow (Q&S) Open Drain - open the blowdown valve to drain water from the boiler and test that the boiler will respond.
	- Evaporation test - Close the feedwater line and run the boiler. The boiler will use the remaining water inside and run until LWCO is triggered.
- LWCO should be cleaned and inspected at least once a year to ensure it is constantly in operating condition.
- An electric boiler which does not use gas is the only boiler which does not require an LWCO.

# Miscellaneous
- One disadvantage of electric boilers is that they require a lot of energy to run.
- Operating voltage for an electrode type boiler can be as high as 16,000 volts.
	- Additionally, the amount of steam that it produces depends on the amount of water in the basket.
- Immersion electric boiler can have a capacity of up to 2700 hp.
- Control of the immersion heater boiler is done by turning on and off the heating elements.
