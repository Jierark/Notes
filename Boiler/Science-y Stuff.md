This sections details some science that boiler operators should be familiar with.

# Heat
The three relevant types of heat are latent, specific, and sensible heat.
- Latent heat is produced when water changes into steam
- Specific heat is a the amount of heat that is required to raise the temperature of one unit of mass by 1 degree Celsius without changing states. #expand
- Sensible heat is produced from the process of boiling water. This can be measured using a thermometer.
There are three ways of transferring heat: **convection, conduction, and radiation**.
- Convection occurs when heat is carried around by the movement of fluids. When particles in a fluid are heated up, they become more energetic, expand (which lowers density), and expand, allowing them to rise up in the fluid. Colder particles are then circulated to the lower areas, creating a continuous flow inside the fluid.
- Conduction occurs when heat is transferred within or between materials in contact with each other. The hotter object will transfer its heat to the colder object until they reach an equal temperature. This is the reason why we can perceive things as feeling "hot" or "cold"
- Radiation occurs when heat is transferred by electromagnetic waves. This is the only way that heat can transfer within a vacuum. An example of radiation is the heat of the sun reaching earth, or a fire transferring heat to the surrounding area.
The typical units to measure heat are degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on locale.
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: F = 9/5 \*C +32
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: C = (F - 32)\* 5/9
# Draft and Air
Draft refers to the difference between atmospheric pressure and the pressure existing in the furnace or flue gas passage (alternatively, the combustion chamber area).  Air naturally moves from high pressure to low pressure. Influencing this can move air in a desirable way within the boiler. In boilers, there are three kinds of draft to keep in mind:
- Natural draft occurs due to the natural movement of air. Hot air is less dense and rises, while colder air is more dense and tends to fall.
- Forced draft moves air inside the boiler. This is typically done using a fan or blower (which literally forces the air to move inside).
- Induced draft moves air to exit the boiler. This is achieving by the use of a chimney or stack, which pushes air out through the chimney using a fan between the boiler and chimney.
There are also three terms for the air to keep in mind:
- Primary air is mixed with fuel in the burner to give the conditions for a combustion reaction.
- Secondary air pushes the flame into the boiler.
- Excess air is any unspent or unusable air which exits the boiler.
# Positive and Negative Pressures

# Combustion
Combustion reactions involve reacting some kind of fuel with oxygen, producing a flame. The resulting products are water, heat, and some other gases. However, if carbon monoxide is present in the products, this indicates a sign of low combustion efficiency. It will also produce smoke and soot, as well as being a major toxin.

The three components to support combustion are fuel, heat, and oxygen (fire triangle). Complete combustion of fuel requires mixture, atomization, temperature, and time #clarify  , and it will produce carbon dioxide and minimal amounts of excess air.
# Miscellaneous Science
- **Purging** is the first sequence in the series of automatic burner control. It cleans out any gas and dust that had been sitting in the burner.
- The **Absolute Pressure** of the boiler is the pressure on the gauge plus 14.7 psi (natural pressure at sea level).
- 1 Boiler Horsepower (HP) is equivalent to producing 34.5 pounds of water at 100 degrees Celsius/212 degrees Fahrenheit, per hour.
- **Heating Surface** refers to a surface where water exists on one side, and hot gas on the other. This results in transfer of heat from the gas to the water.
- The pH of water in the boiler should be between 7.5-8.5. pH determines if the water is acidic (<7.0), basic/alkaline (>7.0), or neutral (=7.0).
- Clean water maintenance inside the boiler is important #clarify . Natural water, whether from tap or city line, contains minerals and other pollutants  which needs to be treated to prevent formation of scale (see [[Operation and Maintenance of Boilers#Boiler Blowdown]] for more details). Additionally, there are chemicals which can be added to treat the feed-water.
- First law of thermodynamics states that heat and work are mutually convertible #expand 
- Second law of thermodynamics states that transferring heat from a cold substance to a hot substance (such as in refrigeration) will require external work or energy.
