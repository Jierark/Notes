The role of a boiler is to contain and heat up some kind of fluid, typically water. The heated fluid, which isn't necessarily boiling, can then be used in various processes, such as water heating, power generation, or sanitation.

# Types of Boilers
Boilers are generally defined by how the water and heating elements are contained and how they interact with each other.
## Fire-tube Boilers
In a fire-tube boiler, hot gas traverses through tubes, which heats up the surrounding water. These boilers operate at pressures up to ~250 psi and are suited for smaller applications due to the slower heating of water.
- Increasing the number of tube passes augments the heat transfer capability (more surface area to heat up water)
## Watertube Boilers
Water-tube boilers utilize the tubes to transport water, with the hot gas surrounding the tubes. This design choice allows these boilers to withstand much higher pressures than fire-tube boilers, 
## Sectional Boilers
Sectional boilers replace the use of tubes in favor of larger "sections" which can be attached together to form the vesicle to store fluid. The heating element then circulates around the sections. These boilers also operate on lower pressures, and are typically smaller than the tube-based boilers.

Other ways to define boilers are their use case or their operating pressure. **Heating boilers** produce hot water to heat up a residential or commercial area, whereas **Process boilers**, also known as **power or industrial boilers**, produce much more hot water for industrial purposes. **Low Pressure** boilers have a max working pressure of 15 psi, operating pressure of 160 psi, and operate below 250 degrees Fahrenheit, while a **High Pressure** boiler can withstand conditions above those listed.


## Acquiring a boiler's license
Boiler licenses depend on the specifications of the boiler. Boilers between 6 and 100 horsepower and operating over 15 psi requires a high-pressure special license, also known as the ***white seal***. In order to be eligible for this license, the applicant must have a minimum of 90 days experience with a boiler between 6 and 100 horsepower. This license is typical for dry cleaning store owners, or other equipment that requires high volumes of steam such as autoclave. Note that this only applies to New Jersey; other states may classify their licenses differently. 

There is a 30 day wait period after failing the boiler exam to retake it.
# Boiler System
A steam boiler consists of 4 components:
- Feedwater system
- Fuel system
- Draft system
- Steam system
Hot water boilers have a similar structure, with two key differences:
- Make-up water system
- Fuel system
- Draft system
- Hot water piping system
