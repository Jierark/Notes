This study guide is intended for those who are planning to achieve a White Special Boiler License. Most of the information in this guide is adapted from the study guide that my parents used when they went for their exam, but I decided to make it more presentable, fixing grammatical issues and adding some more depth to some of these points.

Most of the details were generated based on the questions that have come up on previous boiler exams, but my brain doesn't like studying like that. Anything under bullet points or a few sentences are possible question/answer combos that have been seen on a previous exam. Longer form points are also relevant details, but are written so that one can understand the path of logic.

Sections are detailed by relevant category
