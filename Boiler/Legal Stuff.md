This sections some of the regulations that boiler operators need to keep in mind during operation.
# Emissions
The first Clean Air act passed in 1963 to regulate emissions. In 1990, a series of amendments were passed to further the role of the government in protecting the environment. Out of the eleven titles passed under this act, Title I is the most important.
## Title I
Title I covers attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), putting its focus on six "criteria" pollutants: Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulates, and Lead. Under Title I, the government established monitoring stations to determine whether locations have exceeded any of the levels set for these six pollutants.

An area is designated as an "attainment" area if it does not exceed the limits. Those that do exceed limits are designated as "nonattainment area", and further classified to the level of ambient pollutants, ranging from "marginal" to "extreme".
